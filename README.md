# FreeCAD-Geoosm workbench
This workbench is being developed to temporary provide functionality to import osm data with heights. The time beeing this will be merged into trails workbench.


## Functions
There is only on tool to import osm data with heights. It even looks like the import tool of trails. This because it uses the import widgets from trails.


## Installation
Download and extract the ZIP file into the `.FreeCAD/Mod` folder or use git to clone into `.FreeCAD/Mod`


### Dependencies
FreeCAD-Geoosm dependend on FreeCAD-Trails and some packages to retrieve the heights. At the moment none of them seams to fullfill all requirements. Thus it is not decided which one will be used eventually when the code will be merged into trails.
